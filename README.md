# barclaycard
This was a challenge event I attended as part of my university (University of Northampton)
where we were required to create an internal tool to process events and tasks within barclaycard.
We were partitioned into groups and had to extarct vital information from key stakeholders within the company to allow
us to create solution which was bespoke to BarclayCard.

We devised a website as the solution using HTML,CSS,PHP and Docker.
