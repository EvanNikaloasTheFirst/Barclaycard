## BarclayCard 💳
This was a challenge event I attended as part of my university (University of Northampton)
where we were required to create an internal tool to process events and tasks within barclaycard.
We were partitioned into groups and had to extarct vital information from key stakeholders within the company to allow
us to create solution which was bespoke to BarclayCard.

We devised a website as the solution using HTML,CSS,PHP and Docker.


# University Coding Challenge 🏫 - BarclayCard 💳

I was fortunate enough to be invited into a 2 day coding challenge hosted by BarclayCard to participate in a coding challenge where we were required to produce an internal tooling system
which increased the level of productivity regarding dealing with customer issues.

We carried out interviews, brain-storming sessions and critical thinking to produce a fullstack web based product. 

## The tool 🛠️
We used HTML, CSS , PHP and Docker to create a fully administrated software which allowed staff memebers to deal with their tickets online.

There were 3 levels of priority

Managers - They had the ability to delegate, complete, delete , reassign tickets and view all completed, in-progress and tickets that haven't been started.

Supervisors - They has the ability to delegate tickets and view all tickets under all status.

Staff members - They could complete their tickets, view all of their complete, tickets which haven't been started and in-progress tickets. As-well as pick up tickets from the ticket lobby.

## My role 👨‍🚀
We had a team of 4 and I was single-handedly repsonsible for the front and backend developement of the system.
I built it over the course of the two days and it was a challenge but something I did learn from.
